/N  admission	h	Admission and Application Requirements
/N  admission	p	Applicants who satisfy the general /N  admission requirements of the Graduate School will be considered for /N  admission to the Master's program in Biological Sciences. <strong>Application deadlines</strong> are typically one month prior to the start of the semester for which the prospective student is applying, but applicants wishing to receive full consideration for a teaching or research assistantship should apply by March 15 for fall /N  admission and October 1 for spring /N  admission. If you intend to apply for a Competitive Graduate Award (CGA), the deadline for submitting all of your application materials is the first Friday in December of the previous year by 4:30 PM. If you apply for the CGA but your SIUE application is incomplete, your award application will be removed from consideration. <a href="http://www.siue.edu/graduate-students/funding/competitive-award.shtml" target="_blank">Click here</a> to find out more about the CGA.
/N  admission	p	The application process includes completing an application to the SIUE Graduate School, submitting all required documents, and finding a faculty member in Biological Sciences who is willing to act as mentor.
/N  admission	p	In order to apply for /N  admission to the Master's program in Biological Sciences, you must complete ALL of the items on the following checklist:
/N  admission	o	Complete the <a href="http://www.siue.edu/apply/index.shtml" target=" _blank=">SIUE Graduate School Application</a>
/N  admission	g	This can be done online or a hard-copy application can be downloaded and mailed.
/N  admission	o	Pay the $40 application fee
/N  admission	o	Submit a Personal Statement/Letter
/N  admission	g	The letter should summarize the applicant's preparation and experience leading to the undertaking of a Master's program of study at SIUE, and outline the applicant's academic and career goals, highlighting the role that a Master's degree in Biological Sciences at SIUE will serve in meeting those goals. The letter should be e-mailed or mailed to SIUE Graduate Admissions (address below).
/N  admission	o	Submit Official Academic Transcripts
/N  admission	g	The applicant should ask their universities or colleges to mail the official transcripts directly to SIUE Graduate Admissions (address below). Students accepted into the Biological Sciences graduate program are expected to have completed course work equivalent to the requirements for the SIUE undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences. If not, they will be expected to resolve any deficiencies by completing additional course work beyond that required for the graduate degree. Upon /N  admission to the program, the student shall consult with his or her faculty mentor to review the student's academic record, and develop a plan of study that will address any perceived academic deficiencies.
/N  admission	o	Submit at Least Two (2) Letters of Recommendation
/N  admission	g	These letters will preferably be from professors, instructors and/or individuals who are familiar with the applicant's academic and professional preparation for undertaking a Master's degree in the Biological Sciences. The applicant should ask the references to e-mail or mail their letters directly to SIUE Graduate Admissions (address below).
/N  admission	o	Submit Official GRE Test Scores (if required)
/N  admission	g	GRE scores are only required if the applicant has a cumulative undergraduate GPA less than 3.0 (out of 4.0). If required, the official GRE scores should be mailed to SIUE Graduate Admissions (address below).
/N  admission	o	Find a Faculty Mentor
/N  admission	g	Applicants will not be accepted into the Master's program in Biological Sciences until a faculty member in the department has agreed to act as mentor. It is the responsibility of the applicant to identify a mentor that would be a good fit for their research interests, and to contact that faculty member about becoming the applicant&#8217;s mentor.
/N  admission	g	Applicants can access a list of the faculty, with contact information and research interests, by <a href="http://www.siue.edu/artsandsciences/biologicalsciences/faculty-staff/faculty.shtml" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. Applicants should review the information on the web pages and select a faculty member <span style="text-decoration: underline;">who has compatible research interests</span>. Applicants must then contact that faculty member to begin a dialogue about their academic/professional interests and to inquire whether the faculty member would agree to act as a mentor.
/N  admission	g	Once a faculty member has agreed to mentor the applicant in a Master's research project, he or she will write a letter to that effect to the Biological Sciences Graduate Program Director. The application file is not considered to be complete until this mentor letter has been added and all other required items have been received.
