home	h	Biological Sciences at SIUE
home	p	The Department of Biological Sciences offers a diverse program of study that allows students to customize their academic path to prepare for numerous career opportunities in research, industry, and government, as well as advanced training in a wide range of professional and post-graduate programs. Our students have the opportunity to study in a variety of subject areas including health sciences, cell biology, molecular biology, biotechnology, genetics, microbiology, functional anatomy, physiology, ecology, evolutionary biology, wildlife management, and conservation biology.
home	p	The mission of our department is first and foremost to challenge and engage our students, and to produce graduates with a comprehensive, integrated education in the biological sciences. We value a high level of student-faculty interaction and engagement. All of our faculty have active research programs, which provide both undergraduate and graduate students with opportunities to participate in new and ongoing projects.
home	p	Our department, together with the SIUE campus, provides excellent facilities and many opportunities for innovative biological study. In 2013 the department moved into Science Lab West, a modern science education facility with well-appointed teaching and research labs. The department is equipped with state-of-the-art technology in microscopy, physiology, histology, cell biology, microbiology, genetics, and toxicology research, and has extensive botanical and zoological teaching collections. We have our own greenhouse and vivarium facilities for plant and animal research. The 2,660-acre SIUE campus includes a 75-acre lake, a 35-acre botanical garden, and 380 acres of forest and restored prairie set aside as the SIUE Nature Preserve, all of which serve as an outdoor classroom and research space.
ecology	h	Ecology, Evolution & Environment at SIUE
ecology	p	Recent rapid advances in technology combined with a growing awareness of the impact of human activity on the environment have resulted in the development of broad opportunities in environmental biology. Ecology is the study of interactions between living organisms and their environment. Evolution provides the theoretical basis that binds all of biology together. These areas combine to help us understand human impacts on natural systems. These areas have both academic and practical importance because they stimulate intellectual curiosity about the natural world and provide a scientific basis for the solution of modern environmental problems.
ecology	p	The ecology, evolution and environment specialization within the biological sciences bachelor’s program prepares students for positions that require the application of ecological principles to the solution of environmental problems. The specialization also prepares students for advanced study in all areas of biology, including wildlife ecology and forestry. Students selecting this specialization will take a planned sequence of courses that includes basic biological sciences, ecology, evolution and environmental science. This study may include laboratory and field research.
genetics	h	GeneticsGenetics and Cellular Biology Specialization at SIUE
genetics	p	Biology includes the whole domain of living things: patterns of cellular structure; the underlying biochemical pathways; anatomy and function of whole organisms; the mathematical predictability and molecular basis of inheritance; the flow of energy and matter through living systems; the regulation and interaction of basic life processes; the universality of adaptation; and the interdependence of the biosphere. Like all sciences, biology is both cumulative and open-ended in its discoveries. It teaches the wonders of life, the excitement of discovery and the challenge of the unknown.
genetics	p	Students who are curious about living things, how they function, and how they relate to the environment may want to study biology.
genetics	p	Genetic engineering and cellular biology are rapidly expanding fields in biology.
genetics	p	Genetic engineering is a defined method for producing genetic changes in a variety of organisms in the laboratory. Cellular biology is a field that studies all aspects of gene regulation, protein trafficking, cell physiology, and apoptosis.
integrative	h	Integrative Biology Specialization at SIUE
integrative	p	Students who are curious about living things, how they function and how they relate to the environment may want to study biology.
integrative	p	The curriculum in this program is designed to provide a firm basis in biological sciences for students with a variety of goals. It is an attractive major for students planning to enter graduate school or for students pursuing careers in biological research or in applied work in areas such as agriculture, conservation, and wildlife management. Students in this program may elect to concentrate in such specific disciplines as botany, microbiology, physiology, cellular and molecular biology, genetics, and zoology by completing their electives through courses in these areas. Some disciplines require chemistry courses beyond the minimum requirements.
medical	h	Medical Science Specialization at SIUE
medical	p	The medical sciences specialization is designed principally as a pre-health professions curriculum that will prepare students for entry into medical, dental, pharmacy, veterinary, optometry, osteopathy, chiropractic and podiatry schools, as well as many other allied health professional programs.
medical	p	The medical sciences curriculum has been selected specifically to provide students with a course of study that will satisfy the rigorous entrance requirements of any health-sciences professional school. The medical sciences specialization is also appropriate for students who wish to pursue advanced graduate study in a field of medical research, or opt to pursue entry-level employment in a health-professions related field upon completion of the bachelor’s degree at SIUE.
medical	p	Our health professions advisors maintain a centralized evaluation service to aid students seeking entry into professional schools during the application process. Health professions advising is available in the College of Arts and Sciences Advisement Office to assist interested students with the application procedures for health professions applications.
technology	h	Medical Technology Specialization at SIUE
technology	p	Biology includes the whole domain of living things: patterns of cellular structure; the underlying biochemical pathways; anatomy and function of whole organisms; the mathematical predictability and molecular basis of inheritance; the flow of energy and matter through living systems; the regulation and interaction of basic life processes; the universality of adaptation; and the interdependence of the biosphere. Like all sciences, biology is both cumulative and open-ended in its discoveries. It teaches the wonders of life, the excitement of discovery, and the challenge of the unknown.
technology	p	This degree specialization is designed for students who wish to become medical technologists certified by the American Society of Clinical Pathologists. Medical technologists should have a firm understanding of the theory behind the diagnostic tests they perform in the clinical laboratory. Their responsibilities encompass all clinical laboratory disciplines, such as clinical chemistry, urinalysis, hematology, serology, immunology, blood and organ banking, microbiology, parasitology, and nuclear medicine. As self-motivated, inquisitive scientists, medical technologists contribute to the development of new methods and laboratory instrumentation that aid physicians in preventing and curing disease.
minor	h	Minor in Biology
minor	p	Students wishing to complete a minor in biological sciences must take a minimum of 19 hours of biology courses, at least 9 of which must be completed at SIUE, with a grade point average of 2.0 or higher in all biology courses attempted at SIUE. Due to the sequencing of courses, students are advised that it will normally take at least two years to complete the minor.
minor	p	Courses must include the following: BIOL 150, 151, and 220 (A grade of C or better is required in each of these courses before proceeding to the next course).
minor	p	The remaining hours may be completed with any course in biological sciences except 111, 491, 493 or 494. All the courses in this group have a chemistry prerequisite. Please consult the biology advisor for details.
